# This Project is a Solution to the Problem Stated Below

### Problem 
There is an increase in the number of fake jobs being posted in the online job posting service, which need to be addressed. To do this, the company needs to identify which job posts are likely fake so appropriate measures can be taken against them. Currently, the firm believes that the presence of a logo, salary range, and questions, are key indicators for a job posting being legit and on that note, the company needs to answer questions including; which jobs are likely fake, and what variables are key predictors of this likelihood. Ultimately, the company needs to reduce the number of fake posts on their service, and that being said, another problem arises â€“ at what threshold should they operate to purge most fake job postings, while keeping false positive at a tolerable minimal.
